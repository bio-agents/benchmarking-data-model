    "description": "High Ambiguity Driven biomolecular DOCKing: an information-driven flexible docking approach for the modeling of biomolecular complexes. It distinguishes itself from ab-initio docking methods in the fact that it encodes information from identified or predicted protein interfaces in ambiguous interaction restraints (AIRs) to drive the docking process. It can deal with a large class of modeling problems including protein-protein, protein-nucleic acids and protein-ligand complexes.",
